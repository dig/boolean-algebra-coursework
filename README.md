### Boolean Algebra Coursework: Circuit Optimisation

We were given two circuits named A and B. The task was to optimise these circuits using boolean algebra and karnaugh maps. Workings out can be found in optimisation.pdf.

#### Circuit A
Inputs A, B, C <br />
Output Z, where Z = X’+ Y’ <br />

#### Circuit B
Inputs A, B, C, D <br />
Output Z, where Z = X + Y <br />
